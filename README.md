# MedicalOffice

The application was developed following the RESTful standard with the aim of addressing appointment management at a medical clinic, including consultations. The technologies used for building this application include Python with the FastAPI framework for the backend, JavaScript with the React framework for the frontend, MariaDB and MongoDB databases for data storage, and Docker for container management. Communication between services is done using the HTTP protocol, while gRPC was chosen for the identity manager. The entire application was encapsulated using docker-compose to facilitate its management and deployment.

Furthermore, the goal was to build a highly scalable and efficient architecture. The application consists of 5 services: Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Consultations, and Investigations, as well as an identity manager. All of these communicate through a gateway. ReactJS components were used for the frontend.

The business logic includes 4 tables within MariaDB: User, Patient, Doctor, Appointment, as well as 2 collections in MongoDB: consultations and investigations. MongoDB was chosen due to the dynamic way collections are created, with no standard format for consultations and investigations, which can have different forms.

Authentication is done via JWT, with the token being generated by the identity management service communicated through gRPC, due to the increased speed of HTTP/2 and the security of this protocol. This token is stored in the frontend's localStorage and communicated with each request through HTTP headers.
